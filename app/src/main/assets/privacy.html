We may update our Privacy Notice from time to time. When we do we will communicate any changes to you and publish the updated Privacy Notice on our website. We would encourage you to visit our website regularly to stay informed of the purposes for which we process your information and your rights to control how we process it.</p>

<h2>The information we process</h2>

We will only process special categories of information where we’ve obtained your explicit consent or are otherwise lawfully permitted to do so (and then only for the particular purposes and activities set out at Schedule B for which the information is provided). This may include biometric information, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a person, including, for example, fingerprint or facial recognition or similar technologies to help us prevent fraud and money laundering. Where permitted by law, we may process information about criminal convictions or offences and alleged offences for specific and limited activities and purposes, such as to perform checks to prevent and detect crime and to comply with laws relating to money laundering, fraud, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, and international sanctions. It may involve investigating and gathering intelligence on suspected financial crimes, fraud and threats and sharing data with taxation, law enforcement and regulatory bodies.</p>
<p> </p>

Please note that Swipe will only comply with such requests to the extent it is legally obligated to and depending on your account activity until that date, certain personal data may be maintained in accordance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing legislation to which Swipe is subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Changes to the way we use your<br/>Information</h2>
<p>From time to time we may change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we will notify you and will allow a period of at least 30 days for you to raise any objections before the change is made.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How we may use and share your<br/>information with other swipe group<br/>companies</h2>

<p>L.   where permitted by law, it is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, and it is not inconsistent with the purposes listed above.</p>
<p>If you ask us to, we will share information with any third party that provides you with account information or payment services. If you ask a third-party provider to provide you with account information or payment services, you’re allowing that third party to access information relating to your account. We are not responsible for any such third party’s use of your account information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they provide to you. In the event that any additional authorised users are added to your account, we may share information about the use of the account by any authorised user with all other authorised users. Swipe will not share your information with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your permission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sharing with third parties</h2>
<p>We may transfer your information to or your information may be collected directly by organisations in other countries (including other Swipe group companies, for example in Ukraine, where Swipe’s Customer Support function is located) on the basis that anyone to whom we pass that information or who collects it directly protects it in the same way we would and in accordance with applicable laws. In the event that we transfer information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (which includes countries in the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), we will only do so where:</p>
<ol>
<li>  the European Commission has decided that the country or the organisation we are sharing your information with will protect your information adequately;</li>
<li>  the transfer has been authorised by the relevant data protection authority; and/or</li>
</ol>
<p>C.   we have entered into a contract (deed of adherence) with the organisation with which we are sharing your information (based on the model clauses proposed by the European Commission) to ensure your information is adequately protected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Marketing Information</h2>
<p>Upon signing up to use Swipe’s services, you consented to and told us that you want to hear from us regarding marketing updates, as is expressly stated at the Sign-Up stage of opening a Swipe Account. We will send you relevant marketing information (including details of other products or services provided by us or other Swipe group companies which we believe may be of interest to you), by email. If you change your mind about how you would like us to contact you or you no longer wish to receive this information, you can simply unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking “Unsubscribe” in any previous communication we have sent or by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:Privacy@swipe.io">Privacy@swipe.io</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Communication about your account</h2>
<p>We will contact you with information relevant to the operation and maintenance of your Swipe account (including updated information about how we process your personal information), by a variety of means including via, email, text message, and in-app notifications. If at any point in the future you change your contact details you should tell us promptly about those changes. We may monitor or record calls, emails, text messages or other communications in accordance with applicable laws for the purposes outlined in Schedule A – Purposes of Processing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fraud prevention</h2>
<p>We may access and use information from fraud prevention agencies when you open your account and periodically to:</p>
<p>A.   manage and take decisions about your accounts;</p>
<ol>
<li>  prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering; and</li>
</ol>
<p>C.   check your identity and verify the accuracy of the information you provide to us;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Application decisions may be taken based solely on automated checks of information, for example from fraud prevention agencies and internal Swipe records. To help us make decisions on verifying your Swipe account, as well as transaction limits on your Swipe account, we look at information you give us when you apply for a Swipe Account; including biometric data such as your photograph and/ or facial scan, information regarding your location, age, nationality and/ or citizenship and other information which enables us to verify your identity and perform a risk assessment for money laundering and fraud prevention purposes. You have rights in relation to the automated decision-making used in the verification process, including a right to attempt account verification again, or contact our Customer Support team if your application is refused. We will also profile your Swipe Account to assign a risk rating for the purposes of fraud and unusual transaction monitoring and unauthorised access prevention. The information we will use to profile you will include your age, bank country of residence and status as a politically exposed person or otherwise. We will continue to collect and monitor information about how you manage your Swipe account including your account balance, payments into your account, the regularity of payments being made, and any default in making payments, while you have a relationship with us. This information may be made available to other organisations (including fraud prevention agencies and other financial institutions) so that they can take decisions about you. If false or inaccurate information is provided and/or fraud is identified or suspected, details will be passed to relevant fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies and other organisations may access and use this information. We cooperate fully to the extent of our legal obligations in the prevention of fraud, money laundering and counter-terrorism. If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud, money laundering or other criminal risk, we may refuse to provide the services you have requested, or we may stop providing existing services to you. A record of any fraud, money laundering or other criminal risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your data can be held for up to six years. When fraud prevention agencies process your information, they do so on the basis that they have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity, in order to protect their business and to comply with laws that apply to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How long we keep your information</h2>
<p>By providing you with products or services, we create records containing your information, such as customer account records and activity and transaction records. Records can be held on a variety of media (physical or electronic) and formats, but they are primarily held electronically. We manage our records to help us to better serve our customers (for example for operational reasons, such as dealing with any queries relating to your account) and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Records help us demonstrate that we are meeting our responsibilities and to keep as evidence of our business activities. Retention periods for records are determined based on the type of record, the nature of the activity, product or service, the country in which the relevant Swipe company is located and the applicable local legal or regulatory requirements. We (and other Swipe group companies) normally keep customer account records for up to six years after your relationship with Swipe ends. Retention periods may be changed from time to time (or waived where deemed low-risk) based on business or legal and regulatory requirements. Where there has been no activity on your Swipe account since it was opened, we may delete your data after a period of 6 months, as you will be deemed an &#8220;unactivated user&#8221;. If there has been any transactional activity on your account, we will maintain your data until you request that we delete it, unless we are obligated to maintain such data to comply with our legal obligations. We may on exception retain your information for longer periods than those stated above, particularly where we need to withhold destruction or disposal based on an order from the courts or an investigation by law enforcement agencies or our regulators. This is intended to make sure that Swipe will be able to produce records as evidence, if they’re needed. If you would like more information about how long we keep your information, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:Privacy@swipe.io">Privacy@swipe.io</a></p>
