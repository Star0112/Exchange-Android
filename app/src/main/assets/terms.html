<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE: RISKS OF TRADING VIRTUAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>Any kind of trading of virtual assets and currencies involves significant risk. The value of virtual assets / currencies has high volatility (value can increase and decrease significantly in a very short period of time and at any given moment). Such price fluctuations bring uncertainty. The value of a virtual currency and collapse in demand may be influenced by many factors, including irrational (or rational) bubbles, loss of confidence in the currency, changes in software development, government decisions, creation of a competitive currency, technical problems, political or non-political statements, statements of influencers and news and hacker-attacks. Your virtual assets may be lost by losing your password, private key or other security code. There are also other potential risks that may not be foreseen in these Terms.</p>
<p>Virtual currencies have special risks that are not generally shared with the official currencies, because they are not issued by governments, or with commodities or goods that are tangible or registered in the official registry. Virtual currencies are intangible, decentralized, digital assets, backed by technology and trust. No central bank or other institution can take any measures to protect the value of virtual currency. Virtual currencies are autonomous and largely unregulated system of firms and individuals issuing currencies.</p>
<p>The risk of loss in trading, buying, selling or holding virtual assets / currencies can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading in virtual assets / currency or any levered or derivative virtual assets is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. Be careful to keep your private keys, passwords, security codes and words for yourself and change them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Swipe uses payment providers for transfers of fiat money for rendering exchange services and operating with the fiat money, whereas assisting banks do not, by any means, represent a medium of exchange, transfer, withdrawal, deposit or other transaction in connection to virtual currencies.</p>
<p>Swipe shall not ask you for any password or private key, nor shall we ask users to transmit any funds, Bitcoins or other virtual currency to our bank account, Bitcoin address, Ethereum address or other addresses, which are not listed on the trading platform. Please do not trust any discount or promotion related information. Swipe shall not be responsible for any losses caused by transmitting funds from/to bank accounts, or virtual funds to any addresses that are not listed or given to you on the trading platform.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND TRADING LIMITATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The exchange services, operated by Swipe, allow users to buy, sell and store virtual currencies such as but not limited to: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litcoin, EOS, Ripple, Stellar and other tokens and coins that are carefully selected by Swipe.</p>
<p>Our exchange does not offer any coins or tokens that are or might be considered as securities.</p>
<p>Swipe services also allow all registered users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy/exchange virtual currency for fiat money<br/>• Exchange virtual currency for virtual currency<br/>• Transfer virtual currencies to other Swipe wallet addresses or other third party wallet addresses<br/>• Storing virtual currencies in the Swipe virtual currency wallet</li>
</ul>
<p>Every user has to open a user account (for detailed instructions see the section “CREATING AN ACCOUNT” down below or check the instructions on the website in “How Swipe works” section), connect your bank account or your payment card (Mastercard, Visa or other debit card).</p>
<p>Swipe uses only EUR as a conversion currency. All prices on the Swipe platform are shown in EUR. USD or other fiat currencies are currently not possible to use for exchange on Swipe platform. Swipe reserves the right to add other conversion currencies in the future. Swipe also reserves the right to remove any of trading pairs in future.</p>
<p>Swipe offers users to buy virtual currencies with EUR or credit cards (Visa and MasterCard). Swipe does not offer to use debit cards (Maestro), bonus cards or other means at this moment. Swipe reserves the right to add other means of payment in the future.</p>
<p>If a user wishes to use a Credit Card payment and pay in his native fiat currency (USD, GBP, or other), the amount that user wishes to use to obtain virtual currency will be converted to EUR currency by the credit card provider.</p>
<p>You may request a withdrawal of your virtual assets of fiat equivalent of such assets, subject to the limitations as stated in the Terms. The amount of funds for payments and withdrawals of fiat money are limited per day and per month. For purpose of purchasing virtual currency, user can make a deposit of maximum of 20.000 EUR per day and maximum of 100.000 EUR per month. In case that this daily amount exceeds the set limit, the excess amount will be automatically returned to users bank account from which user has made SEPA payment. If the user made a payment using a credit card for the amount higher than a daily limit, Swipe will process the payment of the amount reaching the daily limit and deny the payment of the excess amount. The limitation applies to natural persons. This is a precautionary measure for AML purposes.</p>
<p>The amount of deposited, traded, transferred or withheld virtual currency per day and month is not limited.</p>
<p>Swipe will make its best endeavor to provide users with the Service in a timely manner and as soon as possible, however there is no guarantees that access will be uninterrupted, or that there will not be any delays, failures, errors, omissions, or other impairments of the system or the loss of the transmitted data. While Swipe has made every effort to ensure continuity, speed and security of the Services, we are unable to completely foresee and hedge every legal, technological and other possible risk, including but not limited to force majeure, hacker attack, system instability, virus, flaw in third-party services, act of government and other unforeseen risk that may result in service interruption, data loss and other losses and risks.</p>

<p>NOTE that exchanging assets for fiat money or any kind of assets on Swipe platform are final, meaning that user can not return the purchased virtual assets back for the purchase price later and redeem the same amount of money that he spent on purchasing. In case user does not wish to hold his assets, he has to exchange it for the desired asset.</p>
<p><strong>CREATING AND CLOSING AN ACCOUNT</strong></p>
<p>CREATING SWIPE ACCOUNT</p>
<p>Registering with Swipe is a procedure, which every user must complete in order to use Swipe Services. Registration (also known as “Know your customer” or “KYC”) is a mandatory step for every user due to the Anti money laundering rules that Swipe must follow. You can find more about the KYC in the Privacy Policy. Swipe will process your account data you provide when you open Swipe account, perform transactions on the Swipe platform, or use other Swipe Services. This information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information, such as name, home address, email address (which will have to be confirmed), date and place of birth, mobile phone number (which will have to be confirmed by sending you an entry code).</li>
<li>Account information, such as username and password.</li>
<li>Financial information, such as bank account numbers, bank statements, and trading information.</li>
<li>Identity verification information, such as image of your government issued ID, passport, national ID card or driving license</li>
<li>Residence verification information, such as utility bill details, phone bill or similar document.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>The source of the account data is user who opens an account. The account opening data will be used and processed for the purposes of performing a detailed Know Your Customer (Hereinafter: KYC) procedure according to necessary Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Regulations. KYC process verification is a mandatory step for every new user before his/her first purchase. Swipe will guide you through the process step by step.</p>
<p>Swipe will make a thorough due diligence of each user (natural or legal person) according to our internal risk management policy.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>LOGIN</p>
<p>When login to our platform, user must first enter your email and password. After that user will receive a code via SMS, that user will need to enter in order to sign in and register (for security reasons, you will receive a new code on your mobile number each time you sign-in to Swipe). After entering the code, you will see the control panel of user account.</p>
<p>Every registered user have his/her own wallets on Swipe platform. The wallet consists of the two features: (1) actual wallet for the virtual currency / tokens to be stored and (2) the balance of the fiat, which user deposited for the purchase of virtual currency. We use the term “wallet” for both – wallet for virtual coins and tokens, and balance for the fiat money (EUR). NOTE that Swipe does not offer users a fiat money account. The wallet shows only the balance of fiat money, which is available to user for the purpose of purchasing virtual currency on Swipe platform. The wallet does not serve as a fiat deposit account and user can not make any transaction of fiat money other than to buy virtual currency on Swipe platform. However, the wallet does indeed serve as a deposit / withdrawal and storage account for virtual assets.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>CLOSING SWIPE ACCOUNT</p>
<p>You may close your account at any time. In case you wish to do so, you will need to move your virtual assets to another wallet first. In case there is also a fiat balance shown in your wallet, Swipe will return fiat assets and transfer them to your bank account, which you have previously connected to your Swipe account. By deleting your account, additional processing and bank costs may arise for the user.</p>
<p>If you have purchased virtual currencies only by using your Credit Card and have not yet connected your Bank account with Swipe account, you will have to connect your bank account with your Swipe account in order to get a refund of your fiat money. NOTE: in case of closing your Swipe account, you do not delete your personal data, which we have obtained in the KYC process. More about the deletion of your personal data read in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Even when closing your Swipe account, you will still be obligated to fulfill your responsibilities on pending transactions. In addition, you are responsible to Swipe for any fees incurred before the closure. Swipe may also terminate your account at any time and at our sole discretion, upon notice to you by e-mail or other communication channel. Note that it is in our sole discretion to suspend your access to the Services if it is suspected that you have failed to comply with these Terms, pose an unacceptable fraud or regulatory risk to Swipe or if you provide any false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information. Swipe will not be liable to you for any losses incurred in connection with the closure or suspension of your account by Swipe.</p>
<p><strong>PURCHASES AND WITHDRAWALS</strong></p>
<p>PURCHASING WITH SEPA (BANK ACCOUNT)</p>
<p>Before buying your first cryptocurrency with SEPA deposit, you must add a bank account to your Swipe account and verify it with a deposit of minimum 25 EUR.</p>
<p>You can do that by entering your bank account details (Bank name, SWIFT/ BIC and account number) in to the form. After that, you will receive payment order with the Swipe bank details and your own individualized reference number. User must go to his online bank or go physically to the bank and make a SEPA payment using the payment order. User will get a notification email when Swipe receives the funds to his account. For successful verification of your bank account or credit card, you must deposit at least 25 EUR with the SEPA form. These funds will be shown in your wallet under balance and will be available to make a purchase of virtual currencies on Swipe or withdrawal of the funds back to your bank account.</p>
<p>It usually takes 1-3 days for the fund to be transferred, however it can take up to 7 days to be transferred with the SEPA payment. This is the time that bank needs to process the transaction. Swipe cannot affect this time and shall not be liable for the possible damage that would result from this.</p>
<p>User can connect multiple bank accounts to Swipe account. User who verified one or more of his / her bank accounts to Swipe account, will not be able to make purchases with any other bank account but only with the bank account connected to Swipe account.

<p><strong>ARBITRATION</strong></p>
<p>If it has not been possible to resolve a dispute through the dispute process set out in Section 10.2 or (if relevant), via FOS, any dispute exceeding £5,000 (or EUR 5,500 or equivalent in the local fiat currency that is used in your Customer Account) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding the existence, validity or termination of this Agreement, (a &#8220;Dispute&#8221;) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (&#8220;LCIA&#8221;), which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this agreement. The tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator, unless the LCIA determines that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, a three-member tribunal is appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The place and seat of the arbitration shall be London, England. The language to be used in the arbitration proceedings will be English. The decision of the arbitrators will be final, binding and enforceable against you and us, and a judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. In no event will the arbitrators have the authority to make any award that provides for punitive or exemplary damages. Swipe will pay all the arbitration fees due to LCIA for any Dispute. If you are legally entitled to recover legal fees in relation to any claim, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, Swipe will not seek to have you pay its legal fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. The parties agree to keep confidential all matters relating to the arbitration, including related court proceedings, to the greatest extent practicable. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to the parties also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorised users or beneficiaries of the Swipe Services. Nothing in this Section 10.3 (Arbitration) shall be construed as preventing either party from seeking conservatory or similar interim relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
